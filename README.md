# Power-Electronics-Project
This project presents a comprehensive analysis and performance evaluation of three-phase full-wave rectifiers, a crucial component in power electronic systems for converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). The study focuses on understanding the operational principles, characteristics of three-phase full-wave rectifiers, aiming to provide valuable insights about three phase full wave rectifiers. It covers operational principles; circuit topology and the impact of load variations are explored. The report includes experimental results and case studies to validate theoretical findings which were analyzed and simulated with MATLAB/SIMULINK.
